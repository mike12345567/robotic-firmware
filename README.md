Robotic Firmware
================
Named due to its purpose as a the robotic firmware for my final year project this currently drives 2WD vehicles.

Uses an Arduino Shield, a Particle Shield Shield and a Particle Photon.

The Dagu 2WD robotic kit has been been used as a chassis, along with a 6AA battery holder to get the 8-9V that the 
two 4.5V motors require.

One 6dB 2.4GHz omni directional antenna has been attached to improve WiFi connection, using the u.FL connector on the Photon.
